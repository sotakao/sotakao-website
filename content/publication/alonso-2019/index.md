abstract: In this work, we examine the solution properties of the Burgers’ equation with stochastic transport. First, we prove results on the forma- tion of shocks in the stochastic equation and then obtain a stochastic Rankine–Hugoniot condition that the shocks satisfy. Next, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions in the inviscid case and construct a blow-up criterion. Finally, in the viscous case, we prove global existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions.
