I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Statistical Machine Learning group](https://sml-group.cc/) at the [UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), working on the applications of machine learning to weather and climate science. Previously, I was a mathematician specialising in the mesmerising, yet relatively unknown area of [geometric mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mechanics). I wrote [my PhD dissertation](https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.832210) under the supervision of [Professor Darryl Holm](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~dholm/) at Imperial College London.

Outside of my academic activities, I am also a jazz saxophonist and occasionally gig around London.
